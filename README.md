SimpleSubs - Making Sub Commands Easier
------------------

About
-----
The plugin is a developers tool for creating Sub commands for your plugin. This is done using SimpleSubs.
You can set up an unlimited under of commands and Sub commands all with their own permissions.

SimpleSubs will take care of correctly registering the commands and permissions with the Bukkit API.
It will also register the commands with Bukkits inbuilt help facilities. As well as impliment TabComplete for the top level sub commands.

SimpleSubs will also automatically take care of permissions checking, if the command is valid and has the correct
number of arguments. Displaying the appropriate messages to the user. Leaving you to get on with programming the
command itself.

I decided to release this to help speed up the process of managing Sub Commands. I have been using this for over
9 months so i know it works without a problem. But I have had to tweak it to make it available to you all so let
me know if there are any bugs or you have any feature requests.
